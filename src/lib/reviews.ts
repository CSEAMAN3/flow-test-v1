    review: "I contacted Neil and asked him to complete a CCTV drainage survey on a property I'm buying as it has not been maintained for several decades and I was worried the drains would be in just as bad condition as the house. Neil was super easy to book with, available within a few working days and completed the survey in good time.",

    review: "100% recommend Neil at Flow Plumbing he was an absolute star! Fitted our toilet and replaced our sink part in two hours and he left the place spotless plus taking all the old bits away. He is both very skilled and such a friendly guy, wouldn't consider using anyone else now. Also great value too - highly recommend üíõ",

    review: "We recently contacted Neil after the drains in our new property were blocked. He got to us within 30 minutes. He dealt with the issue swiftly and professionally and told us of damage in our drains we were unaware of. He came back a week later and carried out extensive work relining the collapsed drains without the need of digging up any concrete or grass. He also fixed the flush on a downstairs toilet for us. Neil is very polite and respectful of our home. Would highly recommend.",

    review: "Neil was able to come round quickly when I suffered a blocked outside drain experience, which my rather rudimentary plumbing skills couldn't accommodate. Super knowledgeable, and now I know how my drains all link up. Cleared quickly and I know what to do next time. Went above and beyond with advice and tips. Thanks so much.",

Neil responded to my initial query quickly and carried out a really thorough investigation of our pipes and drain, diagnosing the cause of an intermittent issue we‚Äôve been having for years. Clearly super knowledgable and experienced as well as friendly, professional and efficient. Would absolutely recommend.",

    review: "I had a proper melt down today with an unexpected plumbing issue in my property. Neil came round within the hour between jobs to fix the issue promptly and saved me from further stress. He‚Äôs someone who genuinely seems motivated towards customer satisfaction than profiteering. Many thanks again.",

    review: "I'm so glad Neil has helped resolve my problem and I'm very happy with the results. Neil was able to come up with a simple solution to plumbing a dishwasher in my kitchen. My kitchen space is quite small and is bit awkwardly designed, so I wasn't sure if this would be possible. I'm greatful for his expert knowledge and very happy for the service he provided. Neil was friendly and understanding of the work that needed doing and was able to do the work very quickly at an affordable price. Highly recommend. Thank you üòäüôè",
